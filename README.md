# Revive Motion

Physical therapy web app for guided recovery, sensor ROM tests, Kids Quest, and video knee-motion tracking.

Kids Quest is a physical therapy stretch world for kids — original 3D quest bots, a calm sky UI, and a three-tap map. Stretch with the bots. Photo Goniometer (live camera or tap three points), MPU-6050, and MyoWare 2.0 all count reps and save the reading on this device. Adult clinic pages stay on the light clinic theme.

## Demo clips

`public/demos/revive-motion-whole-app-demo.mp4` is a 1:20 walkthrough of the live app for Congressional App Challenge 2026: homepage and Recovery Passport, patient briefing and charts, Photo Goniometer (marked 126°), live MPU-6050 angle, live MyoWare, the session stack (Photo, MPU, muscle, heart), Kids Quest Heel Slides to 12/12, session report, Spanish, and the clinician dashboard. Real screens and live numbers, not a toy mock.

`public/demos/revive-motion-patient-demo.mp4` is a 42-second clip of the patient loop: Try the demo → today’s briefing and Recovery Passport 76 → Heel Slide with photo / MPU / muscle tiles → live session (Photo + MPU) → live MPU-6050 angle → charts 92° → session report (photo 92°, motion 78°, muscle 412) → Spanish briefing. Real screens and live numbers, not a toy mock.

`public/demos/kids-quest-demo.mp4` is a 30-second clip of Kids Quest only: Knee → Heel Slides → wireless motion, live angle and reps counting to 12/12, then Sam Bot unlock.

`public/demos/revive-motion-clinician-demo.mp4` is a 34-second clip of the clinician loop: Try clinician demo → caseload (Jordan Rivera, Passport 76, peak 92°, 6 clips) → movement review and saved photo/motion clips → push a care plan. Real screens and saved numbers, not a toy mock.

## Demo account

Tap **Try the demo** on the homepage, or sign in:

- Patient: `demo@revivemotion.ai` / `demo123`
- Clinician: `clinic@revivemotion.ai` / `demo123`

The demo patient already has a still photo (92°), a live motion reading (78°), a muscle peak, pain 3/10, and a one-page **Session report** under `/report`. Use **ES / EN** in the header to switch the clinic to Spanish.

The public homepage shows one photo / motion / muscle section that explains each way to measure, plus hip/knee/ankle marks and a progress chart. Signed-in home is the recovery dashboard.

Adult dashboards (home, briefing, care, charts, clinician, session, Photo Goniometer, MyoWare, library, RecoverAI, shop) use the same clinic shell: photo tiles, real rings and heatmaps, Measure · Coach · Report · Improve. Charts use saved clips only — no invented compliance or pain trends.

## Photo Goniometer

Signed-in patients can open **Photo Goniometer** from Dashboard, Charts (Photo tab), or today’s briefing.

1. Choose the exercise, then follow the **Before you record** checklist so the clip is usable.
2. Take a side-view photo or record a short video and tap **Analyze movement**. The coach scores form, compares it to your last clip, and gives the next sets to do.
3. Saved angles, form scores, and next actions stay on this device. Doctors on this device can open a patient and review the movement trend.
4. You can still mark hip → knee → ankle by hand if the camera cannot see the leg.

The estimate is for progress tracking, not a diagnosis. Video files are not stored in the browser database.

## MPU-6050 (Elegoo Uno R3)

1. VCC → Uno 5V. If the pin is labeled only 3.3V, use Uno 3.3V. GND → GND. SCL → A5. SDA → A4. Leave INT empty.
2. Arduino IDE: Tools → Board → **Arduino Uno**. Download `wired-mpu.ino` from the Motion page (`/motion`). File → Open. Upload. Close Serial Monitor.
3. Open Chrome or Edge. Go to **MPU-6050** (`/motion`). Tap **Connect with USB**. Pick the Arduino.
4. The page confirms `HELLO MPU6050 ELEGOO_UNO_R3`, then live `ANGLE` lines. Tape the sensor on the limb and move.
5. If the log says `SCAN none` or `no I2C`, USB is fine and the chip did not answer. Recheck VCC (5V vs 3.3V) and GND, re-upload `wired-mpu.ino`, then swap SCL and SDA.

## MyoWare 2.0 Wireless Shield

Do not use the Elegoo Uno for this. The Wireless Shield is its own ESP32 board.

1. USB into the **Wireless Shield**. POWER SOURCE = VBAT. POWER ON.
2. Arduino IDE: install the **esp32** board package. Tools → Board → **ESP32 Dev Module**.
3. Download `wireless-myoware.ino` from the Muscle page. File → Open. Upload. Close Serial Monitor.
4. POWER OFF. Unplug USB. Snap the shield onto the muscle sensor. Pads: MID / END / REF.
5. POWER ON. Chrome → `/muscle` → **Connect with Bluetooth** → MyoWareSensor1. Flex.

## MyoWare 2.0 (wired Uno)

1. VIN → Uno 5V. GND → Uno GND. ENV → A0. Flip the MyoWare power switch ON. The VIN LED should stay lit.
2. Snap electrodes: MID on the muscle belly, END along the muscle, REF on nearby bone.
3. Download `wired-myoware.ino` from the Muscle page (or open `firmware/wired-myoware/wired-myoware.ino`). Board: Arduino Uno. Upload, then close Serial Monitor.
4. Open Chrome or Edge. Go to **MyoWare 2.0** (`/muscle`). Tap **Connect with USB**. Flex. ENV should rise.

## Heart sensor (live Bluetooth or USB)

A Bluetooth heart-rate strap **or** a wired Arduino pulse sensor can show live BPM.

### Wired (Elegoo Uno R3 + MAX30102)

1. If the power pin says VIN or VCC, use Uno 5V. Leave the sensor 3.3V pin empty. Never put 5V on a pin labeled only 3.3V. GND → Uno GND. SCL → A5. SDA → A4. Leave INT unconnected.
2. Download `wired-heart.ino` from the Heart page (or open `firmware/wired-heart/wired-heart.ino`). Board: Arduino Uno. Upload, then close Serial Monitor. The sketch recovers a stuck I2C bus and will try SDA/SCL swapped if the first scan finds nothing.
3. Open Chrome or Edge. Go to **Heart sensor**. Tap **Connect with USB**.
4. The page confirms `HELLO MAX30102 ELEGOO_UNO_R3`, then live `RAW` / `BPM` lines. Cover both LEDs with a fingertip.

### Bluetooth strap

Polar H9/H10, Wahoo TICKR, Coospo, Magene, and similar BLE heart-rate straps. Apple Watch and many Fitbits do not share heart rate with a website. Joint ROM scan is still a demo.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Optional Supabase keys in `.env.local` come from your Supabase project. The app still runs without them; accounts and goniometer results stay in local storage.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
